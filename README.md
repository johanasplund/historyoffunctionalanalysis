Jean Dieudonné's "History of Functional Analysis" typeset in LaTeX.

I'm trying to stay as close as possible to the original book's style. I may correct a few typos, but for the moment I have only added some missing whitespace.

Current status: introduction + first 3 chapters basically done (a diagram is missing in the introduction), and some bits of few other chapters.

Bibliography is done by hand. Few references have been added.

LuaLaTeX is recommended. I haven't tested it with other compilers.
